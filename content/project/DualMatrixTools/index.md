[DualMatrixTools](https://github.com/briochemc/DualMatrixTools.jl) is a Julia package for solving dual-valued linear systems.

Essentially, it provides an overload for [Julia](https://julialang.org/)'s `factorize` and `\` functions that work with dual-valued arrays.
It uses the dual type defined by the [DualNumbers.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/DualNumbers.jl) package.
The idea is that for a dual-valued matrix

$$M = A + \varepsilon \, B,$$

its inverse is given by

$$M^{-1} = (I - \varepsilon \, A^{-1} \, B) A^{-1}.$$

Therefore, only the inverse of $A$ is required to evaluate the inverse of $M$.
This package makes available a `DualFactors` type which containts (i) the factors of $A$ and (ii) the non-real part, $B$.
It also overloads `factorize` to create an instance of `DualFactors` (when invoked with a dual-valued matrix), which can then be called with `\` to efficiently solve dual-valued linear systems of the type $M \, x = B$.

This package should be useful for autodifferentiation of functions that use `\`.
Note the same idea extends to hyper dual numbers (see the [HyperDualMatrixTools.jl](https://github.com/briochemc/HyperDualMatrixTools.jl) package).

## Usage

1. Create your dual-valued matrix `M`:

    ```julia
    julia> M = A + Îµ * B
    ```

2. Apply `\` to solve systems of the type `M * x = b`

    - without factorization:

        ```julia
        julia> x = M \ b
        ```

    - or better, with prior factorization:

        ```julia
        julia> Mf = factorize(M)

        julia> x = Mf \ b
        ```

        (This is better in case you want to solve for another `b`!)

## Advanced usage

In the context of iterative processes with multiple factorizations and forward and back substitutions, you may want to propagate dual-valued numbers while leveraging (potentially) the fact the real part of the matrices to be factorized remains the same throughout.
This package provides an in-place `factorize`, with a flag to update (or not) the factors.
Usage is straightforward.
By default, `factorize` does *not* update the factors

```julia
julia> factorize(Mf, M) # only Mf.B is updated
```

If you want to update the real-valued factors too, use

```julia
julia> factorize(Mf, M, update_factors=true) # Mf.B and Mf.Af are updated
```
