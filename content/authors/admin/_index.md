I am a postdoc in the [Department of Earth System Science](https://www.ess.uci.edu/) at the University of California, Irvine. 
My research focuses on global marine biogeochemical cycles, which is quite an interdisciplinary field involving mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry, and computer science.

Lately I have been developing [AIBECS](https://github.com/briochemc/AIBECS.jl), a Julia package to allow oceanographers to simulate marine tracers with ease — check it out!
