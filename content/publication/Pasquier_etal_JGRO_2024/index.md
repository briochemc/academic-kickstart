abstract: >
  The deoxygenation of the ocean is an important consequence of climate change that poses an imminent threat to marine life and global food security.
  However, our understanding of how the ocean's oxygen cycle is changing is incomplete because of the complex interactions between changes in circulation, solubility, and respiration that drive global-scale deoxygenation.
  Here we quantify these drivers using a data-constrained model of the global marine oxygen cycle embedded in idealized steady ocean circulations for both preindustrial and future perpetual 2090s conditions taken from climate-model simulations.
  We disentangle the effects of the deoxygenation drivers on preformed oxygen and true oxygen utilization (TOU) using the novel concept of upstream exposure time, which precisely connects TOU to oxygen utilization rates and preformed oxygen to ventilation.
  We find widespread intense deep-ocean deoxygenation due to increased TOU, driven dominantly by a future circulation slowdown that allows respiration to act roughly 2–3 times longer thereby overwhelming the effect of reduced future respiration rates.
  In the upper ocean, decreased respiration and slower circulation closely compensate, resulting in little expansion of upper-ocean hypoxia.
  The bulk of preformed oxygen loss is driven by ventilation shifting equatorward to where warmer surface waters hold less oxygen.
  Warming-driven declines in solubility account for less than 10 % of the total oxygen loss.
  Our results show that the steady-state response of the oxygen cycle to changes in ocean state is driven dominantly by circulation rather than by thermodynamic or biological changes.
